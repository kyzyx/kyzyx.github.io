Hi everyone!

I decided that it was time to update my old undergrad website, as well as
to start writing more regularly. So here I am, and here is my first
Edilogue! According to various internet dictionaries, the suffix -logue
denotes a particular kind of discourse or communication. So an Edilogue
is a communication by me, Edward. Today's Edilogue will be about my plans
for this website.

## Goals ##
* A formal research website, with info about my research and publications.
* A personal website to put info about projects and other references that
  people may find useful.
* A place to write regularly (fingers crossed), with topics including but not
  limited to:
    * Specific technical topics in vision/graphics related to my research,
      written for a technical audience
    * Other more general topics for a technical audience, including
      small tutorial-like snippets of things I might encounter during
      development.
    * Broader technical topics, written for technical and nontechnical
      audiences
    * Hobbies, including board games and music

The structure of the website building tools I'm using encourages putting content
in a blog-oriented, post-centric manner for ease of organization, so all of my
projects will have their own "blog post". These posts generally will be written
in a different style (i.e. less conversational) than my actual blog posts.

## Current Content ##
As of today, the only content is some posts about the more interesting
projects I worked on at Princeton, almost directly copied from my old
website.

Some content of interest that I will not be porting over:

* [My tutorials on using the Kinect for Windows SDK V1 in C++.](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~edwardz/tutorials/index.html)
* [Results of assigned coursework in graphics](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~edwardz/courses.html) that I took at Princeton.

## Future Content ##

In the immediate future, I plan to write a nontechnical blog post about why
I'm doing graduate study in Graphics. I also want to add some posts about some
of my existing side projects, as well as some highlights of the projects I did
in my Princeton grad graphics course COS526.

After this I might start writing about my current research. Beyond that,
in addition to the categories mentioned above, I may try to formalize some
of the advice I am commonly asked to give high schoolers or undergrads.

## Site Internals ##
* Domain name <http://ilogues.com> from [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar)
* Hosting by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Basic site framework from [Jekyll Boostrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
