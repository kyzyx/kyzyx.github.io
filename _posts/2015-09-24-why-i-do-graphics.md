## High School Years at Lisgar ##

I went to high school at Lisgar Collegiate Institute, in Ottawa, Canada. The
teachers were good at giving us academic types the opportunity to try things
outside of standard curricula, often in the form of olympiad-style competitions.
I developed a reputation as the math contest guy, but also did well at physics and
algorithmic programming competitions. However, in these contests I hit a ceiling
very quickly - I could get to provincial finals or the equivalent with very 
little effort, but I was always just short of making it to the national level
selection rounds.

Nevertheless I somehow convinced myself that this kind of clever, puzzly
problem-solving was my thing, so I went into Princeton thinking that I would
dive deep into something like algorithms and data structures, or (less likely)
perhaps some applied math field.

## Finding a specialization ##

### Computational Biology? ###
In the process of choosing classes as a freshman, the Integrated Science
curriculum was advertised as a much more modern and interesting (and more
intensive) way of covering the required introductory science courses. Still in
the competitive academic mindset of high school, I of course took it.

{% comment %}
It was alluring in that it allowed me to continue learning about all the sciences,
but towards a clear goal (rather than taking disparate classes outside of a major).
It let me continue to feel like I was "good at everything" (everything, of
course, meaning the sciences). I also got the challenging, tricky problem sets
of the type that I enjoyed from competitions. I got four A+ grades in freshman
year, all thanks to ISC.

Eventually, in sophomore spring, while working on an overdue biochem problem set,
I decided that ISC, computational bio, and the path I was going down didn't really
fit with my visions of my future. Why? First of all, I hated
labwork, and finishing the course sequence would require a lot more of it. Second,
and more importantly, continuing on that path would mean specializing in
computational biology (which effectively means genetics). While there was nothing
wrong with that in itself, I felt that I wanted to have more generalizable CS
skills and knowledge, more options for places to go and things to do after
graduation, and so on. (Of course, there was also the more immediate benefit of
not having to finish that problem set). So I left behind the ISC classes and
went back to COS.

### Algorithms and Theory? ###
<img src='https://projecteuler.net/profile/Kyzyx.png' class='img-left'>
I still clung to my high school attraction towards programming competitions through
my first two years of undergrad. I'm still proud of my progress in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
during that time, back when there were about 350 problems on the site.


I also took part in the ACM programming competitions in my sophomore year, where
my team was lucky enough to compete at the ACM-ICPC World Finals. While regionals
were a piece of cake, I again found that competition success at the highest levels
was more about practice then whatever natural aptitude I had for that kind of
problem-solving. I think it was after that world finals that I finally gave
up on competition programming for good.

{% comment %}
My programming competition experience has been extremely useful. Besides being
directly applicable to the kinds of coding questions usually posed in technical
interviews, it also gave me an extremely solid foundation in fundamental algorithms.
I also learned how to code quickly and concisely, and how to test and debug
extremely complex code.
{% endcomment %}

I still kept going with algorithms in my coursework, though. I did fairly well
in my CS theory courses, which I mostly attribute to my
math competition experience in high school. However, as I took more classes
in the CS department, I was starting to realize that I preferred to work
further from the abstractions of theoretical CS, and closer to the
concrete applications of CS. However, I did still enjoy the problem-solving
thrill that algorithms courses provided me, enough that I ended up as a TA for a few theory courses in my final two years of undergrad.

### Computer Music? ###
Along with the sciences, math and CS courses, I also took a lot of music
courses, mostly following the normal undergrad music theory curriculum.
(If I hadn't done CS or Math, I would have majored in Music).
It seemed natural for me to try at some point to combine my technical and musical interests.
Rebecca Fiebrink had just joined the Princeton CS department, so in my junior fall I decided 
to try my hand at research with Prof. Fiebrink. The result was
[WaveBeat](research/2015/03/22/wavebeat-a-conducting-system-for-user-directed-gesture-recognition),
a conducting gesture-recognition system.
Unfortunately I did not spend as much time on my independent work
as I (and my advisor) would have liked, but I learned a lot from it. I continued
to take classes with Prof. Fiebrink, and in fact the grad seminar in Interactive
Music Systems I took senior fall led to a publication in [NIME](http://www.nime.org/).

However, I really wanted to work on score-level understanding of music, whereas 
Princeton focused on musical performance and interfaces. More importantly, the
applications of this research area weren't particularly broad. Between these
two points, I decided that specializing in computer music didn't make a lot of
sense for me.

## Getting Into Graphics ##
While I was at Princeton, I took the undergrad computer graphics course in
junior spring with Szymon Rusinkiewicz. I enjoyed the class, and I had a lot of 
fun doing the assignments. However, initially I didn't think too much about it
after the course was over. The following fall, while looking
for fun CS courses to take, I noticed that the [graduate graphics course](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall12/cos526/index.php) fit
neatly into my schedule. I reflected on the good experiences I had with the
undergrad course, and decided mostly on a whim to take it.

Working on [the various projects](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~edzhang/advgraphics/index.html) in the grad graphics course and rediscovering
the things I enjoyed about graphics helped me to solidify the types of things
I wanted to work on in a career. 
Working on raytracers and photon mapping and implementing spatial data
structures highlighted the _interesting algorithmic challenges_ that have
attracted me ever since my high school olympiad days. We could implement
_viscerally satisfying applications_ like interactively deforming meshes,
and we got plenty of _concrete visual results_ from simulating complex
fluid behavior.

The graphics group at Princeton was very friendly, welcoming me to many of
the events and opportunities that were geared towards grad students.
I was invited to the group retreat, attended the weekly graphics talks, and took
a grad seminar on capture and fabrication. These opportunities showed me the
extremely broad set of topics and applications that researchers in graphics
work on, and gave me good a sense of what academic life was like.

## To grad school or not to grad school? ##
Up to the end of my junior spring semester, I was quite certain that I wanted
to go straight to Google after graduation. Somewhere around that point, I had a
chat with a high school friend where we talked about augmented and virtual
reality, sharing interesting videos and startups we had seen online. I got
really excited about the topic, buying all sorts of hardware (such as a Kinect 
and an Oculus Rift DK1) and researching all sorts of topics (from hand tracking 
and gesture recognition to 3D user interface design issues in virtual
environments), and experimenting with various libraries and SDKs. I took this
excitement into the beginning of my senior year, where I decided that I wanted
to make it my senior independent work topic.

My enthusiasm and willingness to work hard on 3D interaction projects even
before the semester started made me reconsider my thoughts on what I wanted
to do after graduation. I put together some grad school applications, with
the initial idea that I would wait and see what options they would add to my
employment offers from Google and Facebook.

## Why Am I Doing A PhD? ##
Between my positive experiences with the Princeton graphics group
and satisfying results from my independent work (a great demo, 
an A grade and a department award), I eventually decided
that grad school was the right place for me. I really enjoyed
experimenting with new technical ideas with viscerally satisfying,
physical results. I figured that the best place to work on cool projects
that could provide these results was in research, and I wanted to continue
working on these sorts of applications while getting a PhD.

Further in the future, I would like to work in an industry research lab.
Working in such a lab requires proven success in doing cutting-edge research, 
and this usually comes in the form of a PhD. However, besides getting experience
and working on cool projects, I think that a more important part of being a grad
student is making connections with people already working in industry
research. The University of Washington graphics and vision group has very close
connections with researchers from Microsoft, Adobe, and Google: I'm co-advised
by Michael Cohen from Microsoft Research, and many other graphics students are
also co-advised by industry affiliate researchers.

## What about after grad school? ##

### Industry Research ###
Large tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, and Adobe,
with the resources to support a dedicated research group,
seem to me like the best place to achieve my goals. Because their core business
is elsewhere, there is less pressure on the research arm of these companies
to work on particular short-term tasks. Instead research can explore interesting
projects that try to push the boundaries of what is possible with technology.
These particular companies have the name, brand visibility, and resources to
make people aware of any new technology and turn it into a polished product.

### Academia ###
The idea of working in academia is actually appealing to me. I like teaching
and I like doing open-ended research. However, there are two issues that make
industry research more attractive to me. First of all, academic research is
centered around publishing. Secondly, the supply of academic jobs is extremely
low compared to the number of available PhDs. The competitive nature of both
of these issues tends to reward more fundamental theoretical contributions
instead of the applications that interest me.

### Startups ###
Caveat: This is probably a gross generalization, and some people more into
the startup sphere might want to argue otherwise. Too bad for you.

My opinion about startups is that there are too many of them. This means that
any particular startup, even if it has good ideas, good execution, and a good
product, will usually be lost in the sea of other companies and products. So
if I want my research to have an impact, become famous, or "change the world",
the visibility and resources provided by large companies make them far better
places to work. Once the right product idea comes along, and the bubble
deflates, I may decide that a startup is the place to go.

## Conclusion ##
So here I am, PhD student at the University of Washington in Computer Science
and Engineering, and here I will be for at least a few more years. I'm here
in the field of graphics and vision because I want to work on interesting
projects with new technical ideas and concrete, physically intuitive
applications. I hope to continue to work on these types of projects after
I graduate, likely at a large company's research division. Things may change
some years down the road, but for now, this is the plan.
